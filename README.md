  BoltRun Recon
  <br>
</h1>


<h3 align="center">Summary</h3>

**BoltRun Recon** automates the entire process of reconnaissance for you. It outperforms the work of subdomain enumeration along with various vulnerability checks and obtaining maximum information about your target.

BoltRun Recon uses a lot of techniques (passive, bruteforce, permutations, certificate transparency, source code scraping, analytics, DNS records...) for subdomain enumeration which helps you to get the maximum and the most interesting subdomains so that you be ahead of the competition.

It also performs various vulnerability checks like XSS, Open Redirects, SSRF, CRLF, LFI, SQLi, SSL tests, SSTI, DNS zone transfers, and much more. Along with these, it performs OSINT techniques, directory fuzzing, dorking, ports scanning, screenshots, nuclei scan on your target.

So, what are you waiting for? Go! Go! Go! :boom:



## ðŸ’¿ Installation

## a) Using a PC/VPS/VM

```bash
git clone https://github.com/six2dez/reconftw
cd reconftw/
./install.sh
./reconftw.sh -d target.com -r
```


```yaml


# Usage

> Check out the wiki section to know which flag performs what all steps/attacks [Usage Guide](https://github.com/six2dez/reconftw/wiki/2.-Usage-Guide) :book:

## TARGET OPTIONS

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| -d | Single Target domain *(example.com)*  |
| -l | List of targets *(one per line)* |
| -m | Multiple domain target *(companyName)*  |
| -x | Exclude subdomains list *(Out Of Scope)* |
| -i | Include subdomains list *(In Scope)* |

## MODE OPTIONS

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| -r | Recon - Full recon process (without attacks like sqli,ssrf,xss,ssti,lfi etc.) |
| -s | Subdomains - Perform only subdomain enumeration, web probing, subdomain takeovers |
| -p | Passive - Perform only passive steps |
| -a | All - Perform whole recon and all active attacks |
| -w | Web - Perform only vulnerability checks/attacks on particular target |
| -n | OSINT - Performs an OSINT scan (no subdomain enumeration and attacks) |
| -c | Custom - Launches specific function against target |
| -h | Help - Show this help menu |

## GENERAL OPTIONS

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| --deep | Deep scan (Enable some slow options for deeper scan, *vps intended mode*) |
| -f | Custom config file path |
| -o | Output directory |
| -v | Axiom distributed VPS |
| -q | Rate limit in requests per second |

## Example Usage

**NOTE: this is applicable when you've installed BoltRun Recon on the host (e.g. VM/VPS/cloud) and not in a Docker container.**

### To perform a full recon on single target

```bash
./reconftw.sh -d target.com -r
```

### To perform a full recon on a list of targets

```bash
./reconftw.sh -l sites.txt -r -o /output/directory/
```

### Perform full recon with more time intense tasks *(VPS intended only)*

```bash
./reconftw.sh -d target.com -r --deep -o /output/directory/
```

### Perform recon in a multi domain target

```bash
./reconftw.sh -m company -l domains_list.txt -r
```

### Perform recon with axiom integration

```bash
./reconftw.sh -d target.com -r -v
```

### Perform all steps (whole recon + all attacks) a.k.a. YOLO mode

```bash
./reconftw.sh -d target.com -a
```

### Show help section

```bash
./reconftw.sh -h
```
